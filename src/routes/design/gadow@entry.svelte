           Gadow... The idea of the gaming social application that never came. The focus was to make "what if discord were a facebook", it was a nonsense, but the idea is a web in which you can interact with friends, know eachother, share your gaming achievements, and even earn points for later, these tokens could be used for in-site purchases, or even exchanging with some outside companies or services.

 I started doing some research; took a pair of guys from the games-testing area and asked them, from favorite game, favorite interface to most used applications daily and what they would like to have from big platforms like facebook and discord.
<br>
 Started with a moodboard, many iterations between the two present designers, while he was working on the brand...

<br>
 sadly, there were some issues and the project was not complete.

The colors were inspired mostly by discord, a certain dark theme but with neon elements to make it "fun" and relaxed
