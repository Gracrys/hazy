          Abenuz was an interesting case, i was told that they had a brandbook and some ideas on what they wanted, so i went directly with the design... which changed enough as to know that they had no idea on how the final product wanted to be, and that changing little detail to detail made me change the entire product over and over, but enough of this, this project was more about making individual components on figma and mixing and matching them, i had some wireframes, but it was more of an agile - extreme development.
